      <h1>Quality Sleep is Important But Never More Than Now</h1>
      <div>

        When you end up not getting minimal sleep during the night, you
        typically feel “off” throughout the following day. Not only can your
        mood and energy level remain low, your workout usually suffers as well.
        This seems to happen when you’re clocking less than 6 hours of sleep a
        night on a consistent basis. In addition, you may also notice you crave
        unhealthy foods following a sub-optimal amount of sleep the previous
        night.
      </p>
      <h3>What’s the Best Definition of Good, Quality Sleep?</h3>
      <p>“Sleep is the best meditation.” <b>~ Dalai Lama</b></p>
      <p>
        Sleep quality, as opposed to sleep quantity, refers to how well you
        sleep. It also includes falling asleep within 30-minutes or less, and
        sleeping through the night without having the need to get up. The one
        final piece you could add to the mix is when you’re awaken, for whatever
        reason, you’re able to fall back to sleep within 20-minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most valuable assets you have are your mind and body and they
        require a certain amount of sleep each night to function optimally. With
        that said, more than 60 percent of the population does not sleep well
        throughout the night. Research shows people getting less than six hours
        of sleep have higher blood levels of inflammatory proteins than those
        who sleep more than six hours. This is important because inflammation is
        linked to diabetes, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, and premature
        aging. This data was published in the Centers for Disease and Control
        and Morbidity and Mortality Report.
      </p>
      <h3>Association Between Quality Sleep and Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        ou work hard in the gym and try to eat healthy to give yourself the best
        chance for success. The last thing you want to do is ruin those odds by
        getting minimal sleep. Research from University of Chicago and
        University of Wisconsin show people who slept more carried less body
        fat. Subjects who monitored caloric intake and averaged 5.5 hours of
        sleep, had more body fat compared to subjects consistently getting 8.5
        hours of sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study looked at more than 1,000
        subjects regarding their sleep patterns. They found those who slept less
        than 8 hours a night had an increase in BMI proportional to decreased
        sleep.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the Recommended Amount of Sleep?</h3>
      <p>
        National Sleep Foundation recommends 7-9 hours of uninterrupted, quality
        sleep for adults (ages 18-64). For older adults (age 65+), they suggest
        7-8 hours of sleep a night. These recommendations were updated in 2015
        and published in Sleep Health: The Official Journal of the National
        Sleep Foundation.
      </p>
      <h3>Final Thoughts on Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        One final comment on the importance of sleep that’s explained nicely in
        the book, Biological Rhythms and Exercise. “Weight-training exercises
        may be unaffected by partial sleep loss early on in a training session,
        but the performance suffers due to lack of drive and concentration as
        the (exercise) session continues.”
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently living in unprecedented times during these past years,
        and stress has affected us all in one or another. Stress is a natural
        physical and mental reaction to how we’re living our life. Use both
        exercise and quality sleep each night to help reduce the amount of
        stress in your life.
